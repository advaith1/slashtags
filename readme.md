# Slashtags

Slashtags is a simple [slash command](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501) tag bot.
* Use `/create` to create a tag, `/edit` to edit a tag, and `/delete` to delete a tag.
* All created tags will show when a user types /, making them easy to discover.
* The Manage Server permission is required to manage tags.
* Due to Discord limits, you can create up to 100 Slashtags. Slash commands do not show in servers with over 50 bots.
